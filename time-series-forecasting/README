Data source: Huberman & Minns (2007) and PWT 9.1 (2019) – Learn more about this data

Note: We plot the data from Huberman & Minns (2007) and extend coverage using an updated vintage of PWT,
which uses the same underlying source. Due to differences in measurement, comparability between countries is
limited.

Advanced Time-Series: Types, Methods, Applications and Top 20 Python Libraries 📈

Advanced time series forecasting involves using machine learning, and deep learning techniques to predict future values of time-dependent data, accounting for complex patterns and seasonality, trends.

——————————

📈 Time series Types:

✶ Univariate
✶ Multivariate
✶ Stationary
✶ Non-Stationary
✶ Seasonal
✶ Non-Seasonal
✶ Irregular
✶ Regular
✶ Additive
✶ Multiplicative
✶ Periodic
✶ Non-Periodic

——————————

⌛️ Here are several advanced time series forecasting methods:

› LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) Networks: A type of recurrent neural network (RNN) capable of learning long-term dependencies.

› GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit) Networks: Similar to LSTM but with a simpler architecture.

› Transformer Models: Uses attention mechanisms to capture dependencies without relying on sequential data.

› TBATS (Trigonometric, Box-Cox, ARMA, Trend, Seasonal): Handles multiple seasonalities and complex seasonal patterns.

› XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting): An implementation of gradient-boosted decision trees designed for speed and performance.

› N-BEATS (Neural Basis Expansion Analysis): A neural network-based approach designed specifically for time series forecasting.

› TFT (Temporal Fusion Transformers): Combines the interpretability of transformers with temporal fusion for time series forecasting.

› Large Language Models (LLMs): LLMs like GPT-4 can be adapted for time series forecasting by encoding time series as text, using embeddings, fine-tuning pre-trained models, combining with traditional methods, and leveraging contextual understanding from text-based data.

Pseudocode:
Import necessary libraries.
Read the CSV file into a DataFrame.
Create a dropdown menu for selecting the entities.
Filter the DataFrame based on the selected entities.
Define a function to preprocess the data for N-BEATS.
Define a function to build and train the N-BEATS model.
Perform time series forecasting for the next 100 years using the N-BEATS model for both average annual and daily working hours per worker.
Plot the data for average annual working hours per worker including the forecast.
Plot the data for average daily working hours per worker including the forecast.
Create a dashboard layout to display the dropdown and both plots.
Update the callback to handle multiple selected entities and update both plots with the forecast.

PROMPT1:

show me python code for a dashboard which reads data from csv called annual-workin-hours per-worker.csv in DATA folder and plots Average annual working hours per worker as a function of Year for Entity to be selected from dropdown menu

PROMPT2:
change the dropdown to allow multiple selections

PROMPT3:
add another figure that shows averaged daily working hours per worker i.e. divide average annual working hours per worker by 365.24 and plot it as function of Year

PROMPT4:
perform time series forecasting on both plots for next 100 years and add results to the plots

PROMPT5:
replace the ExponentialSmoothing algorithm with LSTM network

replace lstm network with gated recurrent unit

replace TBATS with XGBoost

replace xgboost with temporal fusion transformer

replace TFT with neural basis expansion analysis
